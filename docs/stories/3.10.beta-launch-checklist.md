# Story 3.10: Beta Launch Checklist & Epic 3 Validation

**Epic**: Epic 3 - Integration & Production Readiness  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Status**: Draft

---

## Story

**As a** product manager,  
**I want** a comprehensive beta launch checklist,  
**so that** we ensure everything is ready before going live.

**Note**: This story is **primarily a PM/QA coordination task**, NOT a Dev Agent task. It involves validating completed work, coordinating launches, and managing beta recruitment. Dev Agent involvement should be limited to technical verification only (running tests, checking logs).

**Recommended Ownership**: Product Manager (PM) or QA Lead

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Technical checklist (all stories completed, tests passing, performance validated, production deployed)
2. **AC2**: Documentation checklist (README, onboarding guide, FAQ, privacy policy)
3. **AC3**: Support channels checklist (Discord, bug templates)
4. **AC4**: Beta recruitment checklist (email template, Reddit/Twitter outreach lists)
5. **AC5**: Onboarding checklist (signup flow tested, Stripe OAuth tested)
6. **AC6**: Smoke testing production (manual login, trigger webhook, block customer, mobile test)
7. **AC7**: Beta user communication plan (announcement posts, weekly check-ins)
8. **AC8**: Metrics tracking setup (beta KPIs dashboard)
9. **AC9**: Contingency plans documented (backup recruitment, iteration plans)
10. **AC10**: Launch decision gate (PM review, founder approval, GO/NO-GO)

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor)

### Implementation Summary
Created technical validation checklist document (`docs/beta-launch-technical-checklist.md`) to support PM/QA in verifying all technical requirements before beta launch. The checklist covers epic completion, test coverage, performance validation, production deployment, smoke testing, monitoring, security, and documentation verification. All technical verification steps are documented with commands and verification methods. This document serves as a technical reference for PM/QA during the GO/NO-GO decision process.

### Completion Notes List
- Created comprehensive technical validation checklist
- Documented all verification steps with commands
- Included GO/NO-GO technical criteria
- Added quick verification commands section
- All technical requirements from Epic 1-3 are covered
- Checklist designed for PM/QA use with Dev support

### File List
**Created:**
- `docs/beta-launch-technical-checklist.md` - Technical validation checklist for PM/QA

**Note**: All other tasks (AC2-AC10) are PM/QA coordination tasks and should be handled by Product Manager or QA Lead.

### Debug Log References
- Test execution: Commands provided in checklist
- Performance: k6 load test results
- Health checks: `curl https://orylo.com/api/health`
- Monitoring: Vercel Analytics, PostHog Dashboard
- Deployment: Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
