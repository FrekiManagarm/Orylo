**Key AC**:
- OAuth button "Connect Stripe" (Stripe Express pattern)
- Redirect to Stripe OAuth consent screen, scope: read-only payments
- Callback handler stores `stripe_account_id` in `organizations` table
- Multi-tenancy: Each org isolated, no cross-org data leakage

---

### Story 1.2: Stripe Webhook Configuration & Handler
**SP**: 5 | **Status**: Draft | **Epic**: 1

**User Story**: As a system, I want to receive and verify Stripe webhooks for `payment_intent.created`, so that every payment triggers fraud detection automatically.
