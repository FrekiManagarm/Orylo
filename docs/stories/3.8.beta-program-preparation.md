# Story 3.8: Beta Program Preparation - Documentation & Support

**Epic**: Epic 3 - Integration & Production Readiness  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Status**: Draft

---

## Story

**As a** beta program manager,  
**I want** complete documentation and support infrastructure,  
**so that** beta users have excellent onboarding experience.

**Note**: This story is primarily a **PM/Content task**, but Dev Agent may assist with technical documentation (architecture, API references). Most content creation (onboarding guide, FAQ, templates) should be handled by PM or technical writer.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: README.md enrichi (value prop, features, installation, architecture)
2. **AC2**: Beta Onboarding Guide (docs/beta-onboarding.md avec screenshots)
3. **AC3**: Discord community setup (channels: announcements, general, bug-reports, feature-requests)
4. **AC4**: Bug report template (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
5. **AC5**: Feature request template
6. **AC6**: FAQ document (docs/faq.md)
7. **AC7**: Beta recruitment email template (docs/beta-email-template.md)

## Dev Notes

### Context & Integration Points
This story focuses on **documentation and community infrastructure** for beta launch. Dev Agent involvement should be limited to technical documentation only (architecture diagrams, API references). All user-facing content (onboarding guides, FAQ, email templates) should be created by PM or technical writer.

**Dev Agent Tasks**:
- Update README.md with technical architecture
- Create GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- Review technical accuracy of onboarding guide

**PM Tasks** (NOT Dev Agent):
- Write beta onboarding guide with screenshots
- Create FAQ document
- Setup Discord community
- Write beta recruitment email template
- Create feedback collection forms

# Orylo - Real-Time Fraud Detection for Stripe

## Overview
Orylo is an AI-powered fraud detection platform for Stripe merchants. Get real-time alerts on suspicious transactions and take action with one click.

## Features
- **7 AI Detectors**: Velocity, geolocation, trust score, amount anomaly, time-of-day, device fingerprint, BIN analysis
- **Real-Time Updates**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) push new detections instantly
- **Action-First**: Block or whitelist customers with one click
- **Trust Score System**: Adaptive scoring based on transaction history and chargebacks
- **Custom Rules**: (Epic 4) Define your own fraud rules
- **Multi-Tenant**: Supports multiple organizations with data isolation

## Quick Start (Beta Users)
1. Sign up at [orylo.com](https://orylo.com)
2. Connect your Stripe account (OAuth)
3. Configure webhook endpoint
4. Start monitoring detections in real-time

For detailed setup instructions, see [Beta Onboarding Guide](./docs/beta-onboarding.md).

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Better Auth, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis
- **Observability**: Vercel Analytics, PostHog, tslog
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### System Architecture
```

Next.js App (Vercel)

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  API Routes                         │
│  ├─ /api/detections (GET)          │
│  ├─ /api/customers/[id]/block      │
│  ├─ /api/webhooks/stripe (POST)    │
│  └─ /api/events (SSE stream)       │

    ↓                    ↓
Neon PostgreSQL      Redis Cache
    ↓
Stripe API (webhooks, payments)
```

### Fraud Detection Pipeline
1. **Webhook Ingestion**: Stripe sends `payment_intent.created` event
2. **Idempotency Check**: Verify event not already processed (Story 3.1)
3. **Detection**: 7 detectors run in parallel (<350ms)
4. **Decision**: Aggregate scores → Allow/Review/Block
5. **Persistence**: Save detection to PostgreSQL
6. **Real-Time Push**: SSE broadcasts detection to connected clients
7. **Action**: Merchant can block/whitelist via dashboard

## Performance
- **P95 Latency**: <350ms (webhook → detection saved)
- **Detector Speed**: Each <100ms (parallel execution)
- **SSE Latency**: <500ms (detection created → UI update)
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB (frontend)

## Security & Compliance
- **PCI Compliant**: No full card numbers stored (only Stripe tokens)
- **GDPR Compliant**: 90-day data retention, right to deletion
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Row-level security, organizationId isolation
- **HTTPS Only**: Enforced via Vercel
- **Secure Sessions**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
